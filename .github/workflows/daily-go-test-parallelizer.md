# Daily Go Test Parallelizer

Analyze up to twenty-five Go test files per run and add `t.Parallel()` only where parallel execution is demonstrably safe.

## Select a file

1. Use `grep` to list tracked `*_test.go` files containing top-level `Test` functions. Exclude `vendor/` and generated files, then sort paths lexicographically.
2. Read `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/go-test-parallelizer/state.json` when it exists. It has this shape:
   `{"last_file":"path/to/file_test.go"}`.
3. Select up to 25 consecutive paths starting after `last_file`, wrapping to the first path. If the cache is absent, malformed, or names a removed file, start from the first path.
4. Analyze and modify only this selected batch (maximum 25 files).
5. Minimize token usage: avoid re-reading files you already analyzed, and do not paste full file contents into notes or outputs.

## Analyze safety

Add `t.Parallel()` at the start of eligible top-level tests. Also add it to eligible table-driven subtests.
For Go 1.22+ semantics, do not add redundant loop-variable rebinding (`tt := tt`, `cmd := cmd`) unless a case truly needs an additional local copy for correctness.
Read the `parallel-safety-rules` skill before assessing eligibility.

## Batched analysis agent (small context)

1. Call `parallel-safety-batch-checker` exactly once with the selected path list and direct it to read the `parallel-safety-rules` skill.
2. Do not create one sub-agent per file; keep the repeated static rules in this single batch call.
3. Require compact JSON output:
   `{"files":[{"file":"...","safe":true|false,"reasons":["..."],"candidate_tests":["TestName"]}]}`.
4. Use the JSON results to decide which files to edit. Keep aggregation notes short and avoid repeating unchanged rule text.

Do not change assertions, test behavior, production code, dependencies, generated files, or vendored files. When safety is uncertain, make no change.

## Validate

After editing the selected batch:

1. Run `go test -race` once per unique modified package (deduplicate package paths across edited files).
2. Run `go test ./...` once after all candidate edits.
3. Inspect the diff and confirm it contains only safe `t.Parallel()` additions in selected files.
4. Revert the edit and use `noop` if any test command fails or the diff contains any other change.

## Persist and report

Always create `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/go-test-parallelizer/` and write the last path from the selected batch to `state.json`, even when no edit is safe, so the next daily run advances round-robin.

If validation succeeds with a change, create one draft pull request describing the safety analysis and test results. Otherwise use `noop` with the selected path and a short reason.

Given up to 25 `*_test.go` file paths, read only those files and apply this workflow's safety rules.
Return compact JSON only in this exact shape:
`{"files":[{"file":"...","safe":true|false,"reasons":["..."],"candidate_tests":["TestName"]}]}`.
Set `safe` to false when uncertain.

Do not parallelize tests that use or may conflict through:

- `t.Setenv`, `os.Setenv`, `os.Chdir`, or other process-wide state
- shared mutable globals, singleton state, ordering assumptions, or package-level mocks
- fixed ports, fixed filesystem paths, shared databases, or shared external services
- unsafe loop-variable capture, timing dependencies, or explicit synchronization between tests
