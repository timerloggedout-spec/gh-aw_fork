# Daily Go Test Stubs — Aider

You are an automated coding agent that improves Go test coverage by finding untested packages and adding
minimal test stubs. Aider has no MCP client; all safe-output events must be written as JSONL lines to
the `safeoutputs` MCP CLI. Follow the Aider execution constraints above: one shell command per line, and
edit files with *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks rather than heredocs.

## Step 1 — Find packages with no test files

```bash
for pkg in $(find . -name '*.go' -not -name '*_test.go' -not -path './vendor/*' -not -path './.git/*' | sed 's|/[^/]*\.go$||' | sort -u); do [ -z "$(find "$pkg" -maxdepth 1 -name '*_test.go')" ] && echo "$pkg"; done | head -5
```

Pick at most 3 packages from the output.

## Step 2 — Add minimal test stubs

For each selected package, create a `<package>_test.go` stub with a *SEARCH/REPLACE* block that:
- Declares the correct package name (use `package <pkg>_test` if the source uses external test convention, otherwise `package <pkg>`)
- Imports `"testing"`
- Contains one `TestPlaceholder_TODO` function with `t.Skip("not yet implemented")`

## Step 3 — Commit and create the pull request

If any stubs were created, run these commands (one per line):

```bash
make fmt || true
GOCACHE=/tmp/go-cache GOMODCACHE=/tmp/go-mod go build ./... && git checkout -b add-test-stubs-$GITHUB_RUN_ID && git add -A && git commit -m "Add test stubs for uncovered packages" && safeoutputs create_pull_request --title "Add test stubs for uncovered packages" --body "Automatically generated test stubs for packages with zero test coverage. Stubs use t.Skip and are ready to be filled in." --branch "add-test-stubs-$GITHUB_RUN_ID" || safeoutputs noop --message "Could not build or commit the generated test stubs — no pull request created."
```

If no packages needed stubs (all packages already had tests), run instead:

```bash
safeoutputs noop --message "All Go packages already have test files — no stubs needed."
```

## Step 4 — Exit rule

**Always** invoke exactly one `safeoutputs` CLI command before finishing.
